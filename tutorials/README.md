## Solving Graph Coloring Problems with Genetic Algorithm

> graph coloring, genetic algorithm

Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) aims to find a solution that allocates colors to the nodes of a graph so that the neighbor nodes (i.e., nodes connected with an edge) have different colors.

k-GCP refers to GCP with k colors available. In this tutorial, we will look at 3-GCP where three colors (red, green, and blue) are available for the coloring.
