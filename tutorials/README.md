## Genetic Programming

*Genetic Programming* (GP) is a group of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that compose computer programs. GP takes a set of $m$ example I/O pairs $\{(\mathrm{in}_k,\mathrm{out}_k)\}_{k=1}^m$ as the program specification and searches the program that satisfies the given examples. This task to compose computer programs automatically is called *Program Synthesis* (PS).
