Hello, I am He Yifan (何以凡). I am currently a Ph.D student at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. My research interest is Evolutionary Computation (EC). I have conducted several studies on EC, including the following sub-topics.

- Program synthesis
- Seismic history matching
- Self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm
- Portfolio optimization

## Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis

Program Synthesis (PS) requires an intelligent agent to compose computer programs with minimal human efforts. My studies focus on a group of search algorithms called Genetic Programming (GP). GP uses the idea of natural evolution. It starts with a random population of programs, selects the better subsets and updates them until the target program is found.

However, the conventional GPs cannot obtain knowledge from the problem that it has solved. I believe that enhancing GPs with the ability to learn from its experiences can help GPs to generate more complex computer programs.

Therefore, I focus on how can a GP solves problems, extracts knowledge, and uses the knowledge in later problems. I call this problem the Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis problem.
