Yifan He is currently a Ph.D student at the University of Tsukuba. He received his Bachelor and Master degree at Kean University and the University of Tsukuba, respectively. In the undergraduate program, he has conducted research on HCI and recommender systems. He found his interest in optimization when programming an optimization algorithm for the regression model in his Bachelor thesis. Currently, his main research interests include Evolutionary Computation and Multi-Objective Optimization. He is now working on the self-adaptive strategy design for Evolutionary Algorithms.

## [Projects](/projects/)

- **PyBenchFCN:** A Python implementation of optimization benchmarks, both on PyPI and GitHub. Totally, 61 classical single-objective optimization problems are coded based on a MatLab implementation. [<a href="https://github.com/Y1fanHE/PyBenchFCN" target="_blank">LINK</a>]

- **MOEA/D-Lévy Python:** Individual project on GitHub. Developed Python 3 scripts for MOEA/D-Lévy algorithm, an efficient method for solving multi-objective optimization problems. [<a href="https://github.com/Y1fanHE/moead-levy-python" target="_blank">LINK</a>]

- **MOPHiM:** Cooperative project with Heriot-Watt University. Developed optimization algorithm using MOEA/D and Lévy Flight to solve real-world subsurface data assimilation problem under the supervise of Dr. Claus Aranha.
