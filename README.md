## Call for Papers: UbiComp 2024 Workshop

Visit workshop page at [https://idwac.github.io](https://idwac.github.io).

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers, software and medical practitioners, and designers to share and debate both the pros and cons of **applying the Large Language Model (LLM) and Internet of Things (IoT) for diagnosis and personalized training for autistic children**. Through hosting multiple activities during the half-day workshop, including oral presentation, demo and panel discussion, we hope to use this opportunity to build a network of experts to dedicate our efforts on benefiting children with special needs and further inspire the research on taking advantage of the emerging technologies for these under-privileged group users, caregivers and special education teachers.

This workshop explores **the benefits, challenges, and future directions for involving creative interactive design using LLMs and IoT with/for autistic children in diagnosis and personalized training**. By engaging in presentations, demonstrations, and group discussions, participants will have the chance to exchange their related experiences and insights.

Submissions of position papers, work-in-progress reports, or demonstration papers for a short presentation or demonstration related to the interactive design with autistic children using LLM and IoT for diagnosis and personalized training or relevant fields are welcomed. Specifically, the proposed workshop is expecting:

- **Position papers (2-4 pages)** discussing research questions, opportunities, benefits, or challenges.
- **Work-in-progress reports (2-4 pages)** highlighting current research.
- **Demonstration papers (1 page)** illustrating a leading-edge system in use, under development, or at a testing stage.

The suggested topics include (but are not limited to):

- **Optimized and Personalized Training for Special Education**
- **AI, IoT, and/or Smart Sensors for Special Education**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs), and/or Large Vision Models (LVM) for Special Education**
- **Technology-Based Intervention (TBI) for Special Education**
- **Interactive Design with Children**
- **Emerging Applications for Special Education and/or Healthcare**

Authors of accepted works will be invited to present their submissions in a dedicated presentation or demo session.

## Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis

In this research, we focus on **a Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm that improves itself**.

Human programmers write programs every day. If we run a GP algorithm on the cloud and pose PS problem to this GP consecutively, this GP algorithm will face to endless and distinct problems, just like a human. An interesting thing is that we human improve ourselves by practicing on these problems. Very naturally, we want to ask if GP can solve problems and improve itself like a human? Unfortunately, the traditional GP cannot do this. You run GP several repetitions to solve the same problem, the performance does not get better.
