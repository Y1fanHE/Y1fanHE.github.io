## PyBenchFCN

A Python implementation of optimization benchmarks, both on PyPI and GitHub. Totally, 61 classical single-objective optimization problems are coded based on a MatLab implementation. [[Link](/projects/pybenchfcn/)] [<a href="https://github.com/Y1fanHE/PyBenchFCN" target="_blank">GitHub</a>]

## MOEA/D-Lévy Python

Individual project on GitHub. Developed Python 3 scripts for MOEA/D-Lévy algorithm, an efficient method for solving multi-objective optimization problems. [[Link](/projects/moead-levy-python/)] [<a href="https://github.com/Y1fanHE/moead-levy-python" target="_blank">GitHub</a>]

## MOPHiM

Cooperative project with Heriot-Watt University. Developed optimization algorithm using MOEA/D and Lévy Flight to solve real-world subsurface data assimilation problem under the supervise of Dr. Claus Aranha.
