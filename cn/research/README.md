In this research, we focus on **a GP algorithm that improves itself**.

Human programmers write programs every day. If we run a GP algorithm on the cloud and pose PS problem to this GP consecutively, this GP algorithm will face to endless and distinct problems, just like a human. An interesting thing is that we human improve ourselves by practicing on these problems. Very naturally, we want to ask if GP can solve problems and improve itself like a human? Unfortunately, the traditional GP cannot do this. You run GP several repetitions to solve the same problem, the performance does not get better.
