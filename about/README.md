# Résumé

Yifan He is currently a Ph.D student at the University of Tsukuba. He received his Bachelor and Master degree at Kean University and the University of Tsukuba, respectively. In the undergraduate program, he has conducted research on HCI and recommender systems. He found his interest in optimization when programming an optimization algorithm for the regression model in his Bachelor thesis. Currently, his main research interests include Evolutionary Computation and Multi-Objective Optimization. He is now working on the self-adaptive strategy design for Evolutionary Algorithms.
